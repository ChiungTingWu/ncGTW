There are 20 mzxml files serving as an example dataset in this package.

These 20 example files are selected from an in-house metabolites LC-MS dataset
with limited RT and m/z range.

The original dataset contains serum samples from ~2000 randomly selected
individuals. The 20 examples are pooled samples and serve as internal quality
control samples. Separation of metabolites was carried out using a Waters
Acquity Ultra Performance LC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Electrospray
Mass Spectrometry was performed using a Xevo G2S Q-TOF (Waters, Milford, MA,
USA). Chromatographic methods were based on current NPC methodology.
